# Draw Program
Hello, I have created and still improving a Paint like program. Soon I would Add all the tools that Paint have and more.

# How to run the code
  Make sure all the .h, .cpp, .fs and .vs are placed in one folder.
  Make sure the GLM folder is placed with the cpp and h files so for example the #include "glm\glm.h" will work.
  Edit the Include Directories to the Include folder.
  Edit the Library Directories to the libraries folder.
  In Linker Input, edit the Additional Dependencies and add:
    opengl32.lib
    glfw3.lib
  Build the program.
  If any error happens throughout the Build process, contact me on my Email: balasali95@gmail.com.

Thank and Kind regards,

Badraddin Al-Asali
