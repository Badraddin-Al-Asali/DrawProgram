# Draw Program
Hello, I have created and still improving a Paint like program. Soon I would add all the tools that Paint have and more.

# How To Run The Code In Visual Studios
  Make sure all the .h, .cpp, .fs and .vs are placed in one folder.
  Make sure the GLM folder is placed with the cpp and h files so for example the #include "glm\glm.h" will work.
  Edit the Include Directories to the Include folder.
  Edit the Library Directories to the libraries folder.
  In Linker Input, edit the Additional Dependencies and add:
    [opengl32.lib,
    glfw3.lib].
  Build the program.
  If any error happens throughout the Build process, please contact me on my email: balasali95@gmail.com.

Thank you and Kind regards,

Badraddin Al-Asali
