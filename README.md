# Draw Program
Hello, I have created and am still improving a Microsoft Paint-like program. Soon I will add all the tools that Paint has and more.

# How To Run The Code In Visual Studio

  Make sure all the .h, .cpp, .fs and .vs are placed in one folder.
  
  Make sure the GLM folder is placed with the cpp and h files. For example, the #include "glm\glm.h" will work.
  
  Edit the Include Directories to the Include folder.
  
  Edit the Library Directories to the libraries folder.
  
  In Linker Input, edit the Additional Dependencies and add:
  
    opengl32.lib
    
    glfw3.lib
    
  Build the program.
  
  If any error happens throughout the Build process, please contact me on my email: badraddin.alasali@gmail.com.

Thank you and kind regards,

Badraddin Al-Asali
